This project is carried to to showcase my knowledge of react concepts and responsive design which i have been working on to improve recently.

As the name suggests its a simple shopping site with three pages implemented using react routers.Made the page hisghly responsive and performant. Made the codebase as moddular as possible and implemented context api to avoid unnecessary re-render of components.

## What have i learned in this project?

    - Implementing SPA(single page aplication) with react router and dynamic URL's.
    - Usage of Context in react to avoid prop drilling.
    - responsive design & utility classes with tailwind.
    - usage of packages like font-Awesome, React spinners, lucide-react.

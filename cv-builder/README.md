CV-builder is a web app which generates resume/CV(with download as PDF option) with the details provided by the user.

It is developed with proper state management in react for fast dynamic loading of resume as the user enters their details.

What have I learnt in this project?

  - How to handle react components & JSX.
  - Sharing state between components.
  - How to pass objects/arrays down the componets and manipulate them using state.
